# LoginPicture
## Sample Login Application

A simple application to demonstrate logging into a web service.

### Libraries Not Used
If this wasn't a demo, I'd have used the following *CocoaPods*. Instead, I recreated *some* of these libraries' functionality.

* [**Willow**](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow]) - logging library.
* [**Swinject**](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject) - a simple dependency-injection framework.
* [**Alamofire**](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - networking library.
